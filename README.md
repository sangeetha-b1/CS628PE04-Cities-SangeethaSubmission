Input:
The program functions by utilizing user-provided input to initiate a streamlined process, resulting in the creation of relevant output. Users are required to input specific city details, including the city's name and population. This input is facilitated through designated input fields within the user interface.

Process:
After acquiring user input, the program adheres to a well-defined procedure. Initially, the input is gathered and subjected to validation. Subsequently, the processed data is utilized to produce a report tailored to the specific city. The program leverages CSS styling to guarantee a structured arrangement, incorporating a header adorned with a green color scheme and a navigation bar positioned at the center. City details and user inputs are formatted within a container featuring a light gray backdrop, and uniform font styling is maintained across the interface.

Output
The program's result materializes as a city report that is generated based on the provided inputs. This report is showcased within a designated container and encompasses essential particulars such as the city's population and name. The organized layout, a result of meticulous CSS formatting, plays a pivotal role in effectively showcasing the output in a manner that is user-friendly. The green-hued navigation bar serves to emphasize the active link, thereby enhancing the visual intuitiveness of the experience. The resultant city report is thoughtfully presented, mirroring the initial input data, and derives added visual appeal and clarity from the applied styling choices, ultimately enhancing both aesthetics and comprehensibility.
